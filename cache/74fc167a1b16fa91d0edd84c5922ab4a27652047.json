  "prompt": "Create a bold, print-ready illustration and typographic design only (isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows) on a vibrant hot pink solid background. Use thick black vector-style outlines around the isolated elements (text and graphics) ONLY; do NOT add a square frame or border around the entire image. ASPECT RATIO: Design for a 4:5 portrait canvas and fill the ENTIRE canvas — the graphic elements, text, and composition MUST extend to the edges so the design feels full, bold and immersive. Centered composition: large arched display type across the top reading TEXT Hungarian: \"JELENLEGI ÁLLAPOTOM:\" (above) in heavy condensed slab or bold display sans, white fill with subtle distressed texture, thick black outline. In the center place a compact, cartoon-style panel of the dog-at-a-table-in-fire scene: simplified flat-color shapes, saturated palette, minimal shading, crisp edges, coffee cup on table, stylized yellow-orange flames rising, and a speech bubble reading TEXT English: \"THIS IS FINE.\" in uppercase hand-lettered comic font; all illustration elements enclosed by the same thick black vector outline. Below the illustration place large stacked display type reading TEXT Hungarian: \"STABILAN INSTABIL\" (below) matching the top typography style, white fill with slight worn texture and thick black outline. Arrange typography and illustration so they interlock and extend boldly to the canvas edges (crop elements to edges where needed) to avoid large margins or a small centered stamp. Print-ready clean vector style, high contrast, solid fills, minimal gradients, good for screen-printing, centered and immersive composition. Isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows. --ar 4:5",
