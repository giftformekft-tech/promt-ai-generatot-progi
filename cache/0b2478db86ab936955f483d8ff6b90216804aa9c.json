  "prompt": "Isolated print artwork only on a vibrant hot pink solid background. Centered composition, print-ready clean vector design: three dynamic anime-style silhouettes in confident action poses (left and right figures slightly crouched, central figure standing tall) arranged on a subtle horizontal ground line, connected by a sweeping shooting-star arc that starts left, rises over the figures and finishes at a small five-point star at upper right. All graphic elements filled with a smooth left-to-right cyan-to-magenta gradient (teal/cyan at left transitioning to vivid magenta/purple at right). TEXT English: \"HUNTRX\" (below). The word set in bold, uppercase geometric sans with slightly condensed letterforms and tight tracking; the letters share the same cyan-to-magenta gradient fill as the silhouettes and rest directly beneath the ground line, centered and proportional to the figures. Apply a thick black vector-style outline around the isolated elements (text and graphics) ONLY; outlines are uniform, clean, and anchor the shapes for screen-printed or vinyl cut reproduction. No textures, no halftones, no photographic effects, flat smooth color gradients, crisp vector edges, high-contrast, scalable for print. Do NOT add a square frame or border around the entire image. Isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no model, no shadows.",
