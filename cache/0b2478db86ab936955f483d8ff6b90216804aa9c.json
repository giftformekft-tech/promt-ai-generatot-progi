  "prompt": "A clean, centered vector print artwork on a vibrant hot pink solid background. Isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows. Three dynamic anime-style silhouettes in a dramatic action pose arranged left-to-right on a subtle horizontal ground line; a long curved shooting-star arc sweeps from left over the figures to a star at the right. All graphic elements (silhouettes, arc, star, ground line, and logotype) are filled with a smooth left-to-right cyan-to-magenta gradient (bright cyan/teal into electric blue into vivid magenta/purple) and separated from the background by a consistent thick black vector-style outline around the isolated elements ONLY. Below the figures, centered, place bold futuristic geometric logotype: TEXT English: \"HUNTRX\". The type is custom, condensed geometric sans with sharp angular cuts on the R and X, heavy weight, slightly squared terminals, and the same cyan-to-magenta gradient fill as the figures; letterforms have clean negative-space cuts and tight tracking. Overall layout is balanced and symmetrical: silhouettes and arc form an energetic triangular composition pointing right, the logotype anchors the base. Print-ready clean vector appearance, flat gradient fills, crisp edges, no textures, no drop shadows, no photographic effects.",
