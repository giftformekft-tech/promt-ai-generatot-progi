  "prompt": "A centered, print-ready vector artwork on a vibrant hot pink solid background, isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows. Include a clean continuous black contour around the entire artwork. TOP: arched headline in bold, playful rounded display type with strong white fill and subtle dark green inner shading, slightly outlined for contrast. Main graphic: a cute kawaii cartoon cactus centered beneath the headline, symmetrical, rounded pads, friendly smiling face with simple black eyes and tiny rosy blush, a small pink flower on top, evenly spaced short white spikes, sitting in a simple flat brown pot. Surround the cactus with small decorative green confetti triangles and radial accent lines to create energy. BOTTOM TEXT: stacked bold display typography with tight tracking: first small line in solid white uppercase, second large line in vivid lime-to-dark-green vertical gradient with a thin white inner edge and pronounced black contour, third small line in solid white uppercase — all centered under the cactus. Overall composition: balanced, sticker-like layout, flat colors, minimal gradients, thick outlines, high contrast, scalable vector style, print-ready clean design. TEXT Hungarian: \"TÜRELEM RÓZSÁT TEREM\" (above) \"NEKEM KAKTUSZ JUTOTT\". Emphasize legibility at small sizes and harmony between typography and illustration.",
