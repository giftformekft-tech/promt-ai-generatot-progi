  "prompt": "Vibrant, high-contrast print-ready illustration focused ONLY on the printed artwork, transparent background, centered composition, print-ready clean design. TEXT: \"BONTSD\\nMÁNKI\". Typography and layout: top line \"BONTSD\" rendered as a large, custom hand-painted grunge brush script in uppercase, energetic rightward slant, orange-to-yellow gradient fill with white highlights, dark ragged outline and paint splatter distress; second line \"MÁNKI\" in a condensed heavy sans-serif uppercase, solid white fill with thin black outline and subtle halftone texture, acute accent clearly visible on the Á. Stacked, centered typographic lockup integrated with the illustration for strong focal hierarchy: headline dominant, subtitle supporting, balanced negative space for screen printing. Graphics: bold cartoon mascot monkey with exaggerated grin, detailed fur linework, red bandana, cigar detail, and an extended hand holding a shiny green bottle—rendered as clean vector-style art with thick ink outlines, limited color palette and simplified shading for reliable print separations; decorative grunge brush strokes and ink splatters unify text and illustration. Ensure crisp edges, flat printable colors, and isolated layers suitable for vector or high-resolution PNG. Isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows.",
