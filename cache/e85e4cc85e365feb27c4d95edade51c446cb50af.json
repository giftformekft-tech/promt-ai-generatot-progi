  "prompt": "Create a bold vector print artwork on a transparent background, centered composition, print-ready clean design, isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows. TEXT: \"NÉGY\\nKU*VAANYÁD UTÁN...\" Use heavy, condensed display typography with geometric, slightly irregular stencil cuts and tight kerning; letters are solid white with a crisp purple offset outline for pop (keep all edges sharp and vector-friendly). Layout: two stacked centered lines, first line compact \"NÉGY\", second larger \"KU*VAANYÁD UTÁN...\" Surround the text with five playful organic splash/blot shapes (flat solid fills) positioned asymmetrically as accents around the type: teal top-left, yellow top-right, magenta bottom-left, light blue bottom-center, and royal blue bottom-right. No gradients, no textures, no photo effects; flat vector fills, clean outlines, high-contrast, CMYK-friendly color choices, scalable for print. Isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows.",

    "notes": "The image shows three stacked text lines; for the two-line required output I combined the lower two lines into one. The asterisk likely censors a letter in 'KU*VAANYÁD' and diacritics are clear on NÉGY and UTÁN but the second word's exact accented vowel(s) are slightly ambiguous. Placement of the asterisk and exact spacing (KU*VA vs KUV A) is inferred from visual grouping."
