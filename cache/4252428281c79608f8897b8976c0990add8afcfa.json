  "prompt": "Create a centered, print-ready vector illustration of a bold martial-arts emblem on a vibrant hot pink solid background. Feature a pair of stylized wrapped fists facing each other in a slight arc, drawn in flat golden-yellow fills with crisp black line details, a red brushstroke semicircle arc behind the fists and a small five-point gold star centered above the fists. TEXT Hungarian: \"CSAK EGY KAPÁS\" (above) \"VÁLASZT EL...\". Typography: heavy condensed geometric display type with tall vertical stems, sharp angular terminals and subtle vintage athletic stencil cuts; text filled in warm yellow/gold with clean shapes and a subtle internal highlight as vector shapes. Layout: the first line of text is centered above the fists and arc, the second line is centered below the fists, creating a tight badge/crest composition. Visual treatment: flat vector art, high contrast, print-ready clean design, limited color palette, no photographic textures or gradients; include a thick black vector-style outline around the isolated elements (text and graphics) ONLY. Do NOT add a square frame or border around the entire image. Isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows.",
