  "prompt": "MUST include: vibrant hot pink solid background, MUST include: thick black contour around the artwork (sticker style). Centered composition, print-ready clean vector sticker design, isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows. TEXT: \"NEM KELL\" above \"IDE IDÉZET,\" above \"ODABASZ A KINÉZET!\". Only describe the print artwork: a cute kawaii chubby unicorn character centered, winking and puckering with round blush cheeks, taking a selfie with a small phone in one hoof and showing a peace sign with the other; rainbow mane and tail in bright cyan, magenta, yellow and purple; small heart notification bubble near the phone. Behind the unicorn a bold hot-pink paint-splatter accent for energy. Typography: three-line hand-drawn rounded display font, uppercase, white fill with a thick purple inner outline and bold black sticker contour matching the artwork contour; playful, slightly irregular letterforms, heavy weight, tight vertical stacking, clear hierarchy with \"NEM KELL\" largest at top, \"IDE IDÉZET,\" medium, and \"ODABASZ A KINÉZET!\" prominent at bottom. Graphics: clean vector shapes, smooth curves, crisp edges, thick black outline around entire artwork (sticker style), subtle glossy highlights on the character for dimension, no background texture or shading. Centered, balanced composition, print-ready, high-contrast colors, isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows.",

The lower word appears as 'ODAB@SZ' in the artwork; likely intended as the Hungarian vulgar 'ODABASZ' with an '@' stylistic censor. Accented 'É' in 'KINÉZET' is clear. Uncertainty only about the '@' character vs an 'A'."
