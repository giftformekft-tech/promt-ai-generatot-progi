  "prompt": "Centered, print-ready sticker-style illustration on a vibrant hot pink solid background; thick black contour around the entire artwork (sticker style). TEXT: \"PEDRO\" above the illustration. Typography: tall, condensed uppercase display with heavy distressed texture, jagged torn/drip edges, high-contrast white fill with subtle gray speckling and rough ink flecks, slightly staggered baseline for an aggressive, hand-crafted look; bold black inner contour to separate type from imagery. Graphics: three snarling raccoons composed in a dynamic triangular arrangement, rendered as bold grayscale vector/illustrative artwork with clean, sharp shapes, high-contrast shading and white highlights, expressive open mouths showing teeth, detailed fur strokes, energetic motion lines and flying shards/debris around paws to imply breaking through. Layout: text anchored at top, raccoons centered beneath filling the layout, balanced negative space, compact readable silhouette, print-ready clean outlines and separations for easy screenprinting. Overall feel: edgy, high-energy, sticker-friendly graphic with thick black outline. Isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows.",
