  "prompt": "Create a print-ready centered composition of ONLY the PRINT ARTWORK on a vibrant hot pink solid background. Include a single highly detailed white monochrome engraving-style carp illustration, centered horizontally and slightly angled, with fine line hatching, glossy highlights and strong silhouette. Typography: three-line bold uppercase rough brush script with paint-splatter distress texture; the middle line largest and most prominent, the top line smaller and slightly arched, the bottom line wide and weighty. TEXT Hungarian: \"EZ A\" (above) \"NAPOM\" (above the fish) \"FÉMPONTYA\" (below the fish). All text and the fish graphic are isolated elements with a uniform thick black vector-style outline around the isolated elements (text and graphics) ONLY; do not outline the background and do NOT add a square frame or border around the entire image. High-contrast, print-ready clean design, balanced negative space, no drop shadows, no gradients on the background, no additional decorative frames or photo effects. Isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows.",
  "negative_prompt": "no t-shirt, no clothing, no mockup, no fabric, no photo, no realistic scene, no background texture, no shadows, no frame, t-shirt mockup, hoodie mockup, garment, fabric texture, wrinkles, folds, shadows, photo, model, background scene, studio lighting",

    "notes": "Top reads as 'EZ A' (might appear as 'EZA' due to brush style). Middle clearly 'NAPOM'. Bottom appears as 'FÉMPONTYA' in the brush font; the character before the final 'A' could be a 'Y' or a stylized 'J', so the intended word might be 'FÉMPONTYA' or 'FÉMPONTJA'. Accent on the first vowel of the last word looks like an acute accent (É). Brush-script distortion and paint splatter make exact letter shapes ambiguous."
