  "prompt": "Create a bold, print-ready artwork that contains ONLY the print design on a vibrant hot pink solid background. Centered, immersive 4:5 portrait composition that fills the entire canvas with no large margins and no overall border or frame. TEXT Hungarian: \"EZ A NAPOM\" (above) \"FÉMPONTYA\". Typography: two stacked lines of large, all-caps, hand-brushed brush script with heavy white fills and a distressed ink texture, slightly slanted and energetic, letters tightly cropped so they extend to the canvas edges and overlap the central illustration. Graphics: a single large, highly detailed single-color engraved-style carp illustration in white with fine linework and hatch shading, positioned between the text lines and integrated with the typography so fins and tail reach and crop at the image edges. Styling: every isolated element (both text and fish graphic) has a thick black vector-style outline only around those elements; outlines are consistent, crisp and uniform, no outer frame. Use clean vector shapes, high contrast, no photographic textures. The whole artwork must be isolated (no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows), print-ready, scalable, and fill the 4:5 canvas edge-to-edge with the composition feeling full, bold and immersive. --ar 4:5",
