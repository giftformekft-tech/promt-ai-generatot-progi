  "prompt": "Centered, print-ready vector-style artwork on a vibrant hot pink solid background, isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows. A circular badge-style composition featuring a playful cartoon illustration: a cheerful bearded fisherman in flat, bold colors holding a fishing rod with a large leaping fish on the line and a frothy beer mug in his other hand, reeds and a stylized sun and water ripples in the background. Clean shapes, high contrast, minimal shading, crisp flat color fills suitable for screenprinting. Surround the entire illustration with a clean continuous black contour line that outlines the artwork as a whole. Typographic layout: TEXT Hungarian: \"CSAK EGY KAPÁS\" (above) \"VÁLASZT EL A BOLDOGSÁGTÓL\" set in a chunky rounded display font; the top headline arches over the circular scene, the bottom slogan follows the lower curve, both tightly kerned, bold weight, with white fill and a thin colored outline for separation from the illustration. Add small decorative elements (bubbles, dots, simple stars) to balance composition. Centered composition, print-ready clean design, scalable vector look, crisp edges, no photo-realism, no textures.",
