  "prompt": "Print-ready isolated sticker-style artwork on a vibrant hot pink solid background. MUST include: thick black contour around the artwork (sticker style). Centered composition, print-ready clean design. Illustration: a joyful cheering raccoon in mid-foreground with raised arms and an open smiling mouth, stylized painterly/vector fur texture in muted browns and grays with crisp highlights and simplified flat shadow planes for easy screen printing. Behind the raccoon: energetic radial comic-burst rays, ink-splash and star-sparkle accents in cyan and black to create dynamic contrast. Typography and layout: bold chunky rounded uppercase display type reading TEXT: \"PEDRO\" (above) \"PEDRO\" (the top word slightly arched over the raccoon head, the bottom word anchored beneath the raccoon), letters oversized and slightly irregular for a hand-drawn playful feel, color-block fills in turquoise, warm yellow and coral with soft inner highlights and subtle inset shadows, heavy black outline on each letter matching the sticker contour. Graphic details: clean vector edges, limited flat color palette, subtle halftone texture in the burst areas, tiny white highlight speckles, balanced negative space and perfect alignment for print. Explicit: isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows.",
