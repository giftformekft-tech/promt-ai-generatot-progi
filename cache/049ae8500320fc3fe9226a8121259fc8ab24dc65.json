  "prompt": "Vibrant hot pink solid background; centered composition; isolated print artwork only; thick black vector-style outline around the isolated elements (text and graphics) ONLY; no square frame or border around the entire image; print-ready clean design, high-contrast bold shapes, isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows. Typography: bold, chunky playful bubble/retro comic display type in all caps, heavy thick black outline, bright yellow-to-gold gradient fill with subtle orange shading for depth and white highlight streaks on letter tops; letters slightly rounded with compact kerning and exaggerated soft counters for a fun, aggressive sticker look. Layout: stacked, dense vertical hierarchy — large top slogan line, smaller secondary line, very large emphasized central word, then a narrow supportive line and a final punchline line; decorative small puffy white clouds used as separators and overlapping letter edges for layering. Graphics: cheerful cartoon sun face ornament (simple round eyes, wide smile, short radial rays) integrated near the central word as an accent; additional small puffy white clouds and tiny accent stars or sparkles around text. All elements are vector-flat, high-contrast, crisp edges, center-aligned; maintain only the thick black vector-style outline around text and graphics. TEXT Hungarian: \"ÉLJ A MÁNAK!\" (above) \"MERT A HOLNAP VALÓSZÍNŰLEG MÉG SZARABB LESZ!\" Add explicitly: isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows.",
