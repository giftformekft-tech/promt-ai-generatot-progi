  "prompt": "Centered, print-ready clean vector artwork of a bold, playful Hungarian slogan in chunky rounded comic lettering on a vibrant hot pink solid background, with a bold black border framing both the text and all graphic elements; isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows. TEXT Hungarian: \"ÉLJ A MÁNAK!\" (above) \"MERT A HOLNAP VALÓSZÍNŰLEG MÉG SZARABB LESZ!\" Typography and layout: stacked, tightly grouped lines; large heavy rounded display type with thick black outline, crisp white inner highlights, bright golden-yellow gradient fill for main words, smaller condensed uppercase for the midline; slight staggered layering so words partially overlap for dynamic comedic effect; include an additional small curved banner treatment behind the smallest line for emphasis. Graphics: cheerful stylized smiling sun mascot integrated into the composition (simple round yellow sun with a friendly face, white highlights and thick black outline), small fluffy white clouds used as separators and accents around text, all graphic elements sharing the same bold black outline; overall high-contrast, flat vector look with clean edges and no photographic textures, print-ready for screen printing.",
