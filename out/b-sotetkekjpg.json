  "prompt": "Isolated print artwork only, centered composition, vibrant hot pink solid background, bold black border around both the text and the graphic elements. Minimal, print-ready clean vector design featuring three dynamic anime-style hunter silhouettes in a single-row group pose connected by a low horizontal ground line and an arcing shooting-star trail above them. The figures and all graphic elements use a smooth horizontal gradient fill from cyan to electric blue to magenta to purple, with a consistent thick black outline (bold stroke) around every shape and around all text. Typography: strong, condensed geometric sans, all-caps, heavy weight, tight tracking, slightly squared letterforms with a few custom cutouts and diagonal slices to match the angular graphic style; letters are filled with the same cyan-magenta gradient and surrounded by the same bold black border as the illustrations. Layout: silhouettes sit directly above the main logotype, the shooting-star arc frames the top of the composition, and a thin horizontal base line visually ties the characters to the type. Include TEXT Hungarian: \"CSAK EGY KAPÁS\" (above) \"VÁLASZT EL...\" positioned so the first line is centered above the logotype and the second line is integrated as the main headline centered below the silhouettes, no drop shadows, no texture, crisp edges, vector-ready separations for screen printing. Isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows.",
