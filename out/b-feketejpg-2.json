  "prompt": "Centered composition, transparent background, print-ready clean design, isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows. TEXT: \"NYALD MEG\nA BREMET ÖREG\". ONLY describe the print artwork: bold, high-contrast vector cartoon illustration of an angry chubby child shouting, short curly hair, glasses, mouth open mid-yell, raising a middle finger in a defiant pose; upper-body portrait with simplified, clean shapes. Behind the figure a symmetrical laurel/leaf wreath frames the head for visual emphasis. Use thick black outlines, flat color fills, minimal flat shading or subtle halftone for depth, crisp edges, and clean color separations suitable for screen printing. Typography: heavy rounded all-caps display type, white fill with strong dark outline and slight inner stroke for print clarity; top line slightly arched and centered above the illustration, bottom line straight and centered beneath the illustration; balanced kerning and tight leading so text integrates with the art while remaining fully legible. Composition: centered, scalable vector layout, print-ready margins, no photo textures or gradients, limited palette, clean layers for separations. Isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows.",
