  "prompt": "Centered, print-ready clean design on a vibrant hot pink solid background, isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows. Thick black contour around the artwork (sticker style). Bold, hand-drawn cartoon illustration of a weary, slightly sarcastic rooster standing centered holding a steaming coffee mug in one wing, warm textured flat colors, clean vector-ready outlines, subtle distressed texture on fills. Typographic composition integrated with the illustration: TEXT: \"NEM BÍRSZ? HÚZZ EL\" above \"PROBLÉMA MEGOLDVA.\" Use large, condensed, all-caps display type with heavy weight, rough/distressed speckled texture, dark brown fill and subtle off-white highlights, tight tracking and strong horizontal alignment; the top two-phrase headline sits above the rooster and the bottom caption sits below the rooster, all centered. Overall aesthetic: retro sticker/vintage poster, bold black ink outlines, clean separations for screen printing, minimal gradients, high contrast, balanced negative space, isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows.",
