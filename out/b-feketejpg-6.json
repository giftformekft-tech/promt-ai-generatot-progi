  "prompt": "Centered, print-ready vector-style artwork: a bold, high-contrast comic illustration and typographic composition on a vibrant hot pink solid background. MUST include a bold black border around both the text and the graphic elements. Isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows. TEXT Hungarian: \"JELENLEGI ÁLLAPOTOM:\" (above) \"STABILAN INSTABIL\" (below) TEXT English: \"THIS IS FINE.\" (center of illustration). Top headline: large all-caps chunky rounded display type, white fill with subtle distressed texture, heavy black outline and an additional bold black border framing the text block; slight upward arch and tight tracking. Bottom wording: stacked large all-caps condensed display, white fill, matching distressed texture, thick black stroke and its own bold black border, perfectly centered. Center graphic: a framed rectangular comic panel with a thick black frame containing a simplified cartoon dog sitting at a small table surrounded by stylized flat yellow and orange flames, a small coffee mug on the table and a small picture on the wall; speech bubble centered in the panel with the English text in a compact comic sans-style uppercase font, white fill and thin black outline. Overall composition: perfectly centered, balanced hierarchy (headline at top, comic panel center, bold slogan bottom), print-friendly flat colors, heavy black outlines around every element, vector clean edges, screen-print friendly (no photographic detail or gradients), slight tactile halftone or light distressed ink texture allowed for character, maintain readability at various scales.",

Uncertainty stems from possible diacritics and minor letter wear in the distressed print."
