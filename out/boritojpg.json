  "prompt": "Center a single isolated print artwork on a vibrant hot pink solid background. Design a bold, centered composition — isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows. Include a layered triptych of three photorealistic male soccer-player portraits (large frontal portrait centered, left-facing profile behind and slightly larger, small action/celebration figure foreground) integrated into a dynamic splash collage of white and deep red paint splatters, ink strokes and subtle halftone texture. Place large hand-painted brush-script headline text across the lower third in aggressive, slanted uppercase/ligatured script, white fill with heavy rough texture and a thick black vector-style outline around the letters ONLY, slight drop layering so it overlaps the portraits. Add a secondary large numeric element (“7”) in bold condensed sans-serif at the left shoulder area in bright red with white inner highlight and the same thick black vector-style outline. Add a small handwritten brush tag reading GOAT near the top right in white with red accent and thick black vector-style outline. MUST include: TEXT Hungarian: \"CSAK EGY KAPÁS\" (above) \"VÁLASZT EL...\" — render these Hungarian phrases as part of the composition: the first phrase positioned above the portrait cluster in condensed all-caps sans with subtle arced baseline, the second phrase placed directly above the headline in slightly smaller italic condensed sans, both white fill with thick black vector-style outline around the text ONLY. Typography details: primary headline = heavy rough brush-script, very large, tight leading, high-impact; secondary number = geometric condensed sans, oversized; small tags (GOAT and Hungarian lines) = hand-lettered brush or condensed sans to contrast. Composition notes: strong central focal point, balanced negative space, print-ready clean vector edges, simplified shapes for halftone and splatter to ensure sharp screen printing. Color and finishing: white and deep red highlights on portraits and splatters, preserve naturalistic skin tones for faces but simplified for print; all isolated graphic elements and all text must have a consistent thick black vector-style outline (ONLY around text and graphic elements). Do NOT add a square frame or border around the entire image. Final output: print-ready isolated artwork on vibrant hot pink background, high-contrast, bold, and clean for vinyl/screen printing.",
