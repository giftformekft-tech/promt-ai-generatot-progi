  "prompt": "Centered, print-ready vector artwork on a vibrant hot pink solid background. Isolated illustration and typographic composition only, no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows. MUST include a thick black vector-style outline around the isolated elements (text and graphics) ONLY. Do NOT add a square frame or border around the entire image. Design a bold sports-themed centerpiece: a high-contrast vector portrait trio (large frontal portrait, smaller side profile, and a small back-facing silhouette) rendered as clean halftone/photo-illustration vectors with energetic red and white paint-splatter strikes radiating outward from the portraits. Add a simple hand-drawn crown motif above the central head and a small graffiti-style tag reading GOAT near the top right. Typography: dominant white brush-script headline with heavy weight, aggressive brush textures and diagonal slant, paired with a condensed athletic sans for supporting text; all text elements have the same thick black vector outline. Layout: headline layered over the lower portion of the central portrait, secondary sans text placed above the headline and aligned center, crown and GOAT tag balanced top area; maintain balanced negative space and clean scalable vector shapes for print. Include the exact artwork text as required: TEXT Hungarian: \"CSAK EGY KAPÁS\" (above) \"VÁLASZT EL...\". Keep everything isolated artwork only; no garment, no mockup, no fabric, no shadows.",
